# 🧬 LifeSim — Simulate Your Future Path

**LifeSim** is an interactive life simulation app that visualizes your possible life journey over the next 5 years — based on your choices, habits, and mindset. Inspired by storytelling, psychology, and real decision logic, it's built to help you explore "What if?" futures in a personal and meaningful way.

Combines logic, simulation, and emotional storytelling

Teaches rules-based modeling, Streamlit UI, and API integration

Offers real user value, shareability, and customization
